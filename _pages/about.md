Jiatong Li is a 1st year PhD student at [School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), advised by Dr. [Sharon Li](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/). His research interest includes **large language model (LLM) agents, especially their reasoning and reliability challenges**. He tries to resolve the following questions during his PhD study:

- How can we **quantify** the action of agents in real-world scenarios?
- How can we **track** the failure propagation of agent actions in long trajectories?
- How can agents **interact** better with users and environments?


Jiatong Li received his master's degree in 2025 in data science at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), advised by Dr. [Qi Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/). He received his bachelor's degree in data science at USTC in 2022. Previously, he was fortunate to work with Dr. [Mengxiao Zhu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~mxzhu/) at USTC, Dr. [Xiang Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rxT-92AAAAAJ) at [Educational Testing Service](https://www.ets.org/), Dr. [Renjun Hu](https://hurenjun.github.io/) at Alibaba Cloud, and Dr. [Yifei Yuan](https://yfyuan01.github.io/) at University of Copenhagen.
